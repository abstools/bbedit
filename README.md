# A simple Codeless Language Module for BBEdit

The file `abs.plist` in this directory contains support for ABS for
the BBEdit editor (http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/), running
on Mac OS X by BareBones Software.  See the Codeless Language Module
Reference at http://www.barebones.com/support/develop/clm.html.

To activate ABS support, open the Languages tab in the BBEdit
Preferences.  Click on the "Language Modules" link and copy the file
`abs.plist` into the folder that opens (`~/Library/Application
Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/`).
